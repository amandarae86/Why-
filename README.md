# Why-
There truly is one question we all ask at one point or another. We all have a very deep "why?" That we ask ourselves everyday, or almost everyday. Most of the time we will never share that question. I want to now... Why? Why are u different? Why did u pretend for this long? Why couldn't you end the misery sooner?
